Object

### Only accepts string as keys

When you pass anything other than string as key, it will convert it to a string

```js
const key = 1 // type number
const value = "one"

const anotherKey = true
const anotherValue = "true"
const hashmap = {}

hashmap[key] = value
hashmap[1] // cannot be accepted. must pass hashmap['1']
hashmap[anotherKey] = value
hashmap[true] // cannot be accepted. must pass hashmap['true']
```

Map Benefit

### Accept Objects as keys (use WeakMap)

```js
const company = { name: "Uber", category: "Tech" }

// you can use arrays but not search efficient as you have to loop over
const kindOfMap = [[company, { relationship: ["Google", "Facebook"] }]]

// Weakmap
const map = new WeakMap()

map.set(company, { relationship: ["Google", "Facebook"] }) // allows garbage collection of unused object keys
map.get(company)
```

### Don't have to worry about restricted keywards being object keys

```js
const object = {
  toString: "string",
}

console.log(object.toString()) // toString is not a function error because we overrided
```

Considering the use case
When you are in control of the property names that is fine.
But if you are asking the user to fill out the keys for you
then there may be a chance that it collides with a reserved word

### Iterable

```js
const obj = { name: 'ken' }
const map = new Map()

// we are forcefully iterating. not efficient
Object.keys(obj).forEach(() => /* do something*/ )

// we can directly use the for loop here which makes it very efficient
for (const [key, value] of map) {
    // do something
}

```

### Ease of getting the size

Getting the size of the object is not easy

```js
const obj = {
  name: "ken",
}
Object.keys(obj).length // a lot of work being put

const map = new Map([[name, "ken"]])
map.size // very easy
```
