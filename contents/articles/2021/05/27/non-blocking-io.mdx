I\O is one of the slowest opterations a computer can do

Access Time
RAM -> Nanoseconds
Disk/Network -> Milliseconds

Transfer Rate
RAM -> GB/s
Disk/Network -> MB/s ~ GB/s

Although not CPU heavy, it is usually slow with delays.

### Blocking I/O

How it used to be for I/O operations
Whenever, the user tries to access the disk, the thread will be blocked for further execution until the I/O operation complets

```js
// blocks the thread. Can take up to milliseconds for worst case.
data = socket.read()
// prints it. instant
print(data)
```

With a Block I/O mechanism, the only way to accept multiple I/O operations is to create another thread or process.
However, threads shares system resources and it consumes a lot of memory.
Threads may also pass the data down to databases after the reading and during that time, the thread will still keep blocking requests (idle time).
This means there will be many threads that are running but end up just sitting there doing nothing waiting for the operation to end.

### Non Blocking I/O

What modern architectures use to solve the threads from being idle.
When the thread receives a request, it immediately replies back to the requester. If no data,
the response will be a NOT_YET constant (not the exact name).

We can just go to the next lines of code and keep pinging the thread if data is still available.

#### Busy waiting

Pattern where the requester actively polls the resource (thread) within a loop until some data is being returned.

```js
// this is in non-blocking mode
resources = [socketA, socktB, fileA]
while (!resources.isEmpty()) {
  for (resource of resources) {
    // non-blocking
    // tries to access and will immediately get a response
    data = resource.read()
    if (data === NOT_YET) {
      // no data to be read yet
      // just skip this resource and read the next
      continue
    } else {
      // response includes the data so just consume according to the user's needs
      useData(data)
    }
  }
}
```

Looks good but not efficient enough.
This is not super CPU inefficient. Uses a lot of wasted CPU since most of the cases,
resouces will return NOT_YET

### Sytnchronous event demultiplexing

Modern architecture has native mechanism to handle resouces in a non-blocking way concurrently.

#### Multiplexing?

Combine a group of signals into one to solve the problem of having limited capacity over mediums.

#### Demultiplexing

Splitting the merged signal back into their original signals (multiple)

```js
watchedList.add(socketA, FOR_READ)
watchedList.add(fileB, FOR_READ)
// watches if either socketA, fileB resources are ready
// when it is, then it gets assigned to the events variable
// this triggers to go into the while loop

// demultiplexer.watch is synchronous and it will block until either socketA, fileB is ready is ready to be read (resource allocation for the reading)
while ((events = demultiplexer.watch(watchedList))) {
  for (event of events) {
    // it is guranteed that the resources are all allocated at this point of time
    // (to be clear, resources were ready at the point where it entered the while loop)
    data = event.resource.read()
    if (data === RESOURCE_CLOSED) {
      // no more resources will be used
      demultiplexer.unwatch(event.resource)
    } else {
      useData()
    }
  }
}
```

### Benefits to continue using single thread

- Easy to use. Maintaining multiple threads can avoid many hardcore problems (race conditions, etc)
