```js
function require(moduleName) {
  // use(es) the internal require() machinery to look up the
  // location of a module, but rather than loading the module,
  // just return(s) the resolved filename
  const fullPath = require.resolve()

  if (require.cache[fullPath]) {
    return require.cache[id].exports
  }

  const module = {
    id: fullPath,
    exports: {},
  }

  require.cache[fullPath] = module

  loadModule(fullPath, module, require)

  return module.exports
}

function loadModule(path, module, require) {
  const sourceCode = `(function(module, exports, require){
        ${fs.readFileSync(path, "utf-8")}
    })(module, module.exports, require)`
  eval(sourceCode)
}

require.cache = {}
```

### module.exports vs exports

```js
const hello = require("./path")
```

From the example above, we know that the require function returns the module.exports (which is an object containing all the variable properties to be publicly used.)

```js
exports.hello = {
  yo: "what",
}
```

This means we are basically attaching the hello property to the object to be returned from require

```
{
    ...module.exports properties,
    hello: 'yo' <- just adding a new property
}
```

```js
module.exports = {
  yo: "yo",
}
```

We are reassigning the module.exports object to be returned.
This is totally rewriting the module.exports object entirely. Therefore the properties will not be added on to the original module.exports return

### Use case

Originally, module.exports returns a object literal. However, if you want to make module.exports equivalent to a instance or a function, use module.exports

```js
module.exports = () => {
    console.log("yoyo")
}

class Person {
    constructor(firstName) {
        this.firstname = firstName
    }
    ...
}

module.exports = new Person("jim")
```

### Why does NodeJS provide synchronous api alternatives?

You would often see api calls that offer both the async and synchronous ways to handle.
For example,

```js
readFile("filename", "utf-8") // this is asynchronous
readFileSync("filename", "utf-8") // this is synchronous
```

This is because the require function is synchronous. It has to be guaranteed that it read everything before it proceeds to the actual code

```js
// this is synchronous
const hello = require("./path")

// by the time it enters this code, it is guaranteed, ./path is all being handled with
console.log("handled")
```

#### Why can't we lazy load the module?

If the next code relies on the result from the require statement, it is not guaranteed that the result of require is available at the specific moment.
