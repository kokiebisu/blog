### Pattern 1: Exporting a primary data type/object/arrays

We should follow the ==named exports pattern==.
Attach the exporting propties to the exports object

```js
exports.person = "Ben"
exports.dog = {
  name: "John",
  age: 5,
}
exports.names = ["Dan", "David", "Ariel"]
```

### Pattern 2: Exporting a function

We should follow the ==substack pattern==.
Node modules is heavily leaned towards the single responsibility principle.
Therefore the best practice will be to have seperate files containing a single function being exported.
We can also reassign module.exports to the function

```js
// utils/greetings

module.exports = () => {
  console.log("Hi There!")
}
```

The benefit is that it gives a very simple entry point.

We can also extend the capability of the module by attaching the object property

```js
// /utils
module.exports = () => {
  console.log("This is the main responsibility")
}

module.exports.sub = () => {
  console.log("This is the sub responsibility")
}
```

```js
const utils = require("/utils")

utils() // Calls the main responsibility
utils.sub() // Calls the sub responsibilty
```

### Pattern 3: Exporting a class

Classes are only syntactic sugar to functions in javascript. Therefore, it should be treated the same as
how functions are being exported above. We should only be exporting one class ideally to
follow the single responsibility principle.

```js
// models/person
class Person {
  constructor(firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName
  }

  greeting() {
    console.log(`${this.firstName} said hi`)
  }
}

module.exports = Person
```

```js
// main.js
const Person = require("./models/person")
const john = new Person("John")
john.greeting()
```

The benefits are that it is way more syntactically cleaner to extends the module with additional helpers
The drawback is that you will be exposing everything that is included in the class. If you have helpers/private functions it may
not be the best option.

### Exporting an instance

The usecase of this is when you don't want to expose the whole class to the public but but still want to export the capabilties with classes in the backbone.

```js
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.firstName = firstName
  }
  greeting() {
    console.log(`${this.firstName} said hi`)
  }
}

module.exports = new Person("John")
```

!! Since the instance will be cached, all modules that use this will have the exact same instance (property wise and reference wise)
