In default, when you run the command

```js
node main.js
```

nodejs will assume main.js will have the commonjs syntax. It will throw an error if it doesn't align.

There are 2 ways to solve

### Declare on a file base

Simple name the file with the file extension .mjs

### Declare on a project base

In the package.json file, create a type property with the 'module' value attached

```js
// package.json
{
    "name": "project1",
    ...,
    "type": "module"
}
```
