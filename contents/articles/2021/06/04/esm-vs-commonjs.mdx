### ESModules

- Can only be imported at the top
- Cannot not be dynamically imported
- Cannot assign a dynamic name to the imported module
- Since ESModules know all the imports at compile time, it can tree shake all unused imports
- Support for cyclic dependencies
- Can load modules asynchronous
- When we import a module in Nodejs, we always have to specify the file extension '.js'

### CommonJS

- Can be imported anywhere in the code

```js
const hello = "Greetings"
console.log(hello)
require("./module")
```

- Can be imported based on the condition

```js
const selected = "Person"
let object = null
if (selected === "Person") {
  object = require("./person")
} else if (select === "Bird") {
  object = require("./bird")
}
```

- Don't have to write the file extension '.js' for Nodejs
