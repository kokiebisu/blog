Patterns that try to create scalable ways to create objects

Consists of the following:

1. Factory Pattern
   -> Allows hiding the implementation of the creation of the objects
   -> This helps creating object runtime enabling flexibility of implementing

2. Revealing Constructor Pattern
   -> Enables exposing the private object properties and methods during the object's creation

3. Builder Pattern
   -> Simplifies the creation of complex objects

4. Singleton Pattern/Dependncy Injection
   -> Enables wiring up the modules within the application

### Factory Pattern

Enables us decouple the implementation logic with the API surface.
Limits the options to the user enabling a clear point of entry.

```js
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("The Car is moving!")
  }
}

const createCar = name => {
  return new Car(name)
}

const car = createCar("RX-7")
```

The reason why we don't want to directly use 'new' keyword is because,
you would limit yourself to instantiating that specific class.

Let's say we want to abstract this class even further...

```js
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("Driving a car")
  }
}

class Bike {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("Driving a Bike")
  }
}

// We would have to write this logic every time.
// We can optimize this by calling a function that
// enwraps all this logic and decide within itself
// from which class to instantiate
let obj
const name = "Some name"
const objectType = "car"
if (objectType === "car") {
  obj = new Car(name)
} else {
  obj = new Bike(name)
}
```

Can be optimized to this...

```js
class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("Driving a car")
  }
}

class Bike {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  drive() {
    console.log("Driving a Bike")
  }
}

function createVehicle(name, vehicleType) {
  if (vehicleType === "CAR") {
    return new Car(name)
  } else {
    return new Bike(name)
  }
}

const newVehicle = createVehicle("RX-7", "CAR")
```

Example:
We want to create a factory for images that has logic to
figure out which class to instantiate based on the file extension

```js
const createImage = name => {
  if (name.match(/\.jpe?g$/)) {
    return new ImageJpeg(name)
  } else if (name.match(/\.gif%/)) {
    return new ImageGif(name)
  } else if (name.match(/\.png$/)) {
    return new ImagePng(name)
  } else {
    throw new Error("Unsupported Format")
  }
}
```

We can also use factories for encapsulation private properties using closures.

```js
function createCar(name) {
  const private = {}
  const car = {
    setName(name) {
      if (!name) {
        throw new Error("Name must be included")
      }
      private.name = name
    },
    getName() {
      return private.name
    },
  }
  car.setName(name)
  return car
}
```

Here we are returning two things:

1. Car object which takes the role of a accessor to the private properties
2. Private variable which can't be manipulated from the outside. Only by using the car object

#### Practical Example

Switching based on the environment provided

```js
class Debugger {
  constructor(filepath) {
    this.filepath = filepath
  }

  debug() {
    // Does the actual debugging for the filepath
  }
}

class MockDebugger {
  constructor(filepath) {
    this.filepath = filepath
  }

  debug() {
    console.log(`Mocks the debug of ${this.filepath}`)
  }
}

const createProfiler = name => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
    return new Debugger(name)
  }
  return new MockDebugger(name)
}
```

### Builder Pattern

Have you ever had a case where you have a lot of constructor arguments required for a class?

```js
class Person {
    constructor(age, name, hairColor, hairLength, eyeColor, height, nationality, salary, occupation, company, ...) {
        this.age = age;
        ...
    }
}
```

Problem:

1. Difficult to keep track of the arguments and to know the order of it
2. Can't tell if is wrong at runtime
3. Require good documentation to understand since arguments are not categorized

This can be converted to the following:

```js
class Person {
  // By using destructuring, we don't have to think about the argument order
  attachBasicInfo({ age, name, height, nationality }) {
    this.age = age
    this.name = name
    this.height = height
    this.nationality = nationality
  }
  attachHairInfo({ hairColor, hairLength }) {
    this.hairColor = hairColor
    this.hairLength = hairLength
  }
  attachJobInfo({ salary, occupation, company }) {
    this.salary = salary
    this.occupation = occupation
    this.company = company
  }
  createPerson() {
    return new Person({
      ...(this.age && { age: this.age }),
      ...(this.name && { name: this.name }),
      ...(this.height && { name: this.height }),
      ...(this.nationality && { name: this.nationality }),
      // continues on
    })
  }
}

const person = new Person()
  .attachBasicInfo({
    age: 25,
    name: "Ben",
    height: 164,
    nationality: "Canada",
  })
  .attachHairInfo({
    hairColor: "black",
    hairLength: "long",
  })
  .attachJobInfo({
    salary: 60000,
    occupation: "Developer",
    company: "Google",
  })
  .createPerson()
```

The whole point is to use helper methods to assist building the instance on a per category basis
This whole process helps breaking down a complex constructor into multiple steps that are more readable and
easier to follow the logic.
