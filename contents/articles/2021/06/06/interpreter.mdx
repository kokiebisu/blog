### Steps of preparation for Node interpreter when reading ESM

1. Node interpreter starts up and looks for the entry point file
2. Construction Phase
   - Finds all import statements
   - Loads up all the modules being used <- Unnecessary modules will be tree shaken here
3. Instantiation Phase
   - Get reference for all exports from modules (keeps a reference but with no content = undefined)
   - Track all the import, export relations
4. Evaluation phase
   - Finally runs and all the exported entities are filled with actual content

Node reading ESModules
-> No code is executed until the dependency graph is created
-> Executing code is at the last step

!!Doesn't allow lazy loading because dependency graphs must be created beforehand!

Node reading CommonJS
-> Executes the code while simultaneously creating the dependency graph

!! Makes it possible to do lazy loading

### Read-only live bindings

Imported modules can only be read and not modified from other modules

```js
// ./fizz.js
export let message = "fizz"
export function addBuzz() {
  message += "buzz"
}
```

```js
// ./main.js
import { message, addBuzz } from "./fizz.mjs"
console.log(message) // 'fizz'
message += "buzz" // Error! 'buzz' can only be added from where it was exported
addBuzz()
console.log(message) // 'fizzbuzz'
```

The imported variables are binded to the original source.

Commonjs will take a shallow copy from what was exported enabling to modify the imported source.
This also doesn't affect the module from which was exported.
