Should I call the function itself or create a function within and call that instead?

```js
var outer = function() {
    // May something like frequency of the appearance of a number
    const map = {} // If you want to keep a reference outside which tracks progress, create a function within
    function inner() {
        ...
    }
}
```

If you don't have to keep track, just call itself

```js
var test = function(n) {
    ...
    test(n)
}
```
