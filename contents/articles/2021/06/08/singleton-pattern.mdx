Enfore to only have one instance to be shared across modules.

### Benefit

- Sharing the same state/inner info across modules
- Reduce resouce usage (memory heap since we are reference from single source + CommonJS Module System caching of exports)
- Synchronize access to a resources

### However, in Nodejs...

Singleton patterns are not commonly used in Nodejs.
-> We can't follow the singleton pattern in strict terms due to how the module system works.

However there are some specific use cases worth mentioning

### Database instance

Database instances contain information about the database it is connected to.
We don't have to create a new database instance every single time when we want to
do some transactions.

```js
// Using node-postgres as an example
// ./db
const { Pool } = require("pg")

const pool = new Pool({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "database-user",
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 3000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
})

export default pool
```

```js
// ./main.js
import pool from "./db"
```

Here, we can share the same instance across different modules with the same
inner configuration.

### Pitfall

#### Caching Difficulties

Nodejs caches the module, making sure not to execute its code on every import.
Sounds as if all the modules will use the same instance but its not.
There is a limitation that the module has to be under the same package (same package.json at root).
This is because of the nodejs module system caching mechanism. It caches created using the key property as the location path.

```js
// /package.json
{
    "name": "mydb",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "type": "module",
    "main": "dbInstance.js",
}
```

Package A
Depending on my-db version 1

```js
{
    "name": "package-a",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "type": "module",
    "main": "dbInstance.js",
    "depedencies": {
        "my-db": "1.0.0",
    }
}
```

```js
import pool from "my-db"

export function createInstance() {
  return pool
}
```

Package B
Depending on my-db version 2

```js
{
    "name": "package-b",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "type": "module",
    "main": "dbInstance.js",
    "depedencies": {
        "my-db": "2.0.0",
    }
}
```

```js
import pool from "my-db"

export function createInstance() {
  return pool
}
```

Since we have two different major versions of mydb, it will not hoist.
We will have two seperate copies of mydb.

If we try to import these two results, since they are cached as seperate units, the instances will not be identical (reference wise) breaking the singleton pattern in strict terms.
They have the same inner configuration but will not be cashed by the module system.

```js
import { createInstance as a } from "package-a"
import { createInstance as b } from "package-b"

const isSame = a() === b()
console.log(isSame) // -> false
```

If both package-a and package-b has the same major versions (Ex. 2.00 and 2.05), then the package manager would install the mydb
package into the top-level node_modules. This allows having my-db right under the root node_modules directory.
This means that mydb and root will all be coming from the same package so it will be cached properly.

#### Creates tight coupling

Leveraging singleton pattern creates a organized easy to read code but it does not guarantee
maintainability.
-> We can use the Dependency Injection Pattern to solve this
