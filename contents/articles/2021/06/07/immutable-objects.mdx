### What is it?

Objects where the properties cannot be modified after being created.

### Background

Object properties are usually mutable.

```js
// We are using const here!
const object = {
  name: "Ben",
}

// This works because object properties are mutable in nature
object.name = "Ken"

// Direct reassigning will not work
object = anotherObject
```

### Benefit of having immutable objects?

- We can guarantee that the consumer will never change the code even if it
  is being used where you don't have full control.
  We encourage the user to follow a single pattern to modify the object:
  - Copy the object and modify it there
- Detecting changes will be easier because it will always be copied (meaning if will have a different reference)

```js
const stateA = {
    name: 'Ben'
}
// this will have a difference reference to A
const stateB = {
    ...stateA
}
const stateB['name'] = 'Den'

// Can detect if there was any modifications
if (stateA !== stateB) {

}
```
