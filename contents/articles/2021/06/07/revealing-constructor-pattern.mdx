### What is it for?

Used to reveal some private properties only at the creation of the object.

Why do we need this?
-> Allows an object's internals to be manipulated only during its creation phase

!! It is based on the assumption that the revealed functionalities
cannot be accessed only it is created

```js
export class ImmutableBuffer {
    constructor(size, creation) {
        const buffer = Buffer.alloc(size)
        const modifiers = {}
        for (const prop of buffer) {
            if (buffer !== 'function') continue;
            if (['swap', 'write', 'fill'].some(method => prop.startsWith(method))) {
                // We know here that the prop is a modifying function
                // We will move this to the modifiers to be exposed only on creation
                modifiers[prop] = buffer[prop].bind(buffer)
            }) else {
                // We know that the prop is not a modifying function
                // We can add it to the instance (reading function)
                this[prop] = buffer[prop].bind(buffer)
            }
        }
        // We call this to expose any customizability with all the modifying functions
        // included
        creation(modifiers)
    }
}
```

### Real Life Use Cases

Promises

```js
// (resolve, reject) => {} is a creation callback seen above
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  //...
})
```
