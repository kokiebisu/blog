> A pattern that controls access to the class based on the priviledge

All the transactions goes through the proxy and it is the proxy that will call the actual transaction from the subject.

### Benefit

- Can enhance the behavior of the subject under certain conditions (admin, guest)
- Do preprocessing and postprocessing for actions
- If the result is the same everytime, caching
- Logging the result of all the transactions that occured
- Lazy initialization: When a lot of processing is required to the get the object into shape, it can initialize it later

```js
class DatabaseService {
    constructor() {
        // initialize database
    }

    create(data) {
        console.log(`Created data in database`)
    }

    read() {
        console.log('Read data from database')
    }

    update() {
        console.log('Updated data from database')
    }

    delete() {
        console.log('Delete data from database')
    }
}

class DatabaseProxy {
    constructor(service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    create(data, user) {
        if (user.privilege === 'guest') {
            throw new Error('You have no access');
        }
        this.service.create();
    }

    ...
}

const service = new DatabaseService();
const proxy = new DatabaseProxy();

const john = {
    name: 'John',
    privilege: 'guest'
}

const data = {
    email: 'john@gmail.com'
}

try {
    proxy.create(data, john)
} catch (err) {
    throw err
}
```

### Monkey Patching

The pattern in which you completely override the method implementation of the subject.
This can be dangerous though so you want to narrow down the use createPost

```js
class Greeting {
  constructor() {}

  hello() {
    console.log("Hello world")
  }
}

function patchGreeting(greeting) {
  const greetingOrig = greeting.hello
  // If you change the method implementation here,
  // it will affect all the future method calls
  // all greetings after the patch will return 'Bonjour'
  greeting.hello = () => {
    console.log("Bonjour")
  }
  return greeting
}

const greeting = new Greeting()
const newGreeting = patchGreeting(greeting)
const randomGreeting = new Greeting()
randomGreeting.hello()
```

Monkey patching is useful in specific use cases but generally not recommended due to the unexpected side effect which may occur.

### Proxy object

- Also known as "Object Augmentation"
- New feature
- Can intersect methods and their argument and do some preprocessing/postprocessing
