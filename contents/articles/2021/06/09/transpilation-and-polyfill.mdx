### Transpilation

The act of converting one program to another in a different programming language.
In the context of Javascript, it is mainly used to convert programs with newer javascript syntax
to plain (old) javascript so it can be understood across environments.

#### Why do we have to convert?

Because some capabilities in the newer javascript syntax is not available in older environments.

### Polyfill

Code that provides the implementation of APIs that can be understood using plain javascript.
