Display the page directly from Node.js 2. When the page is loaded on the browser, React will perform a process called hydration

### hydration

Adding all the frontend-nly side effects like:

- click handlers
- animations
- additional asynchronous data fetching
- dynamic routing

Basically, making a markup interactive

### Advantage

- Better SEO
  Page markup is prerendered by the server so search engines can go through the markup.
  The search engines don't have to simulate a browser environment and wait for the page to be fully loaded to understand the context.
- Better Performance
  The content is available and ready on the browser. The page can be load the frontend sideeffects while the user checks the page.
