There are multiple ways to branch out code based on the environment the module is running under.

- Run-time Code Branching
- Build-time Code Branching
- Module Swapping

### Run-time Code Branching

```js
function hello() {
  if (window !== "undefined" && window.document) {
    return "Hello Browser!!"
  }
  return "Hello NodeJS!!"
}
```

difficulties

- A lot of unreachable code since the other half will definitely be unused
- Can reduce readability
- Due to how ESModules work, we have to add the import statements at the top of the file. I will include both modules in the final bundle
  !! Bundles have no sure way of knowing the value of a runtime variable at build time.

### Build-time Code Branching

```js
import nunjucks from "nunjucks"

export function sayHello(name) {
  if (typeof __BROWSER__ !== "undefined") {
    const template = `<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>`
    return nunjucks.renderString(template, { name })
  }
  return "Hello"
}
```

Webpack plugins can be used to add extra processing and also remove unused code

```js
// webpack.config.cjs
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin')
module.exports = {
    mode: 'production',
    plugins: [
        // pirce of code that will be evaluated by webpack at build time
        // used to replace the currently matched snippet of code
        // can also be used to pass in environment variables
        new webpack.DefinePlugin({
            __BROWSER__ = true
        })
    ],
    // once it does the processing above, it will minimize the resulting code
    optimization: {
        minimize: true,
        // terser is capable of removing dead code as part of its minimzation algorithm
        minimizer: [new TerserPlugin()]
    }
}
```

Challenges

- Too many if statements resulting in poor readability if overused

### Module Swapping

Have two seperate implementations of the functionality in seperate modules.

```js
// app.js
import { sayHello } from "./src/sayhello"
```

```js
// src/sayhello/index-browser.js
import nunjucks from "nunjucks"
const template = `<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>`
export function sayHello(name) {
  return nunjucks.renderString(template, { name })
}
```

```js
// src/sayhello/index.js
import chalk from "chalk"
export function sayHello(name) {
  return `Hello ${chalk.green(name)}`
}
```
