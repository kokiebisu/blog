The ability to simplify code reuse across different environments in the same project.
Also referred to as Isomorphic Javascript

However there are the difficulties.

NodeJS doesn't have DOMs.
Browsers don't import modules using the filesystem and doesn't contain interfaces to access the operating system.

In terms versioning, (understanding which syntaxes work and are not implemented), Nodejs has the upper hand.
Since we know beforehand which versions Nodejs will use.
For the browsers, some users may still be using an older browser and we can't tell.

Some key considerations:

- Is Async/Await implemented?

### The differences in NodeJS and the browser

Nodejs

- Can directly execute js files and import while executing

Browser

- Reads the index.html file. If it has javascript files (in the form of script elements), it will start reading the javascript file.
- On every import statement (or another script tag), the browser will send a new request (which is time consuming).
- Example:

```html
<body>
<script src="app.js">
</body>
```

```js
import moduleA from "./moduleA"
import moduleB from "./moduleB"
import moduleC from "./moduleC"

console.log("hello world")
```

In this case, the browser will have to import 5 files in total.
Module Bundlers can solve this.

Ideally,

NodeJS -> Execution
Browser -> Build -> Execution
